HTML/TableContentParser version 0.1
============================

This module can be used to parse the content of tables in HTML text. The
parser returns an arrayref consisting of data for each table found within the
passed-in text.

Each table is a hashref consisting of an array of headers, and an array of
rows. Each row consists of an array of cells, which each contain data.

The module inherits from HTML::Parser, which does all the grunt work.
